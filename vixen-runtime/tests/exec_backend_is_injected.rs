//! The process boundary is the EMBEDDER's decision, not the machine's.
//!
//! `vix-core` declares the [`ExecBackend`] seam and ships no implementation of
//! it — the same doctrine as primitives, host types, and the prelude. That was
//! already the design, and `EffectCtx::exec_backend` already failed loudly on a
//! snapshot without one; but `PrimitiveServices::exec_backend()` quietly
//! substituted the host backend for anyone who installed nothing, so in
//! practice the MACHINE decided that vix spawns host processes, invisibly, for
//! every caller. These tests pin both halves of removing that default: no
//! backend is a typed refusal, and an installed one is what makes exec work.
