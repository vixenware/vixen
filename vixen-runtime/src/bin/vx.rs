//! `vx` — a shim that runs one `.vix` file.
//!
//! Deliberately tiny: it reads a file, runs its `#[test]` declarations through
//! the same production path the ratchet drives, and reports each check. It is
//! not `cargo`, it has no subcommands, and it defines no on-disk formats.
//!
//! # The fixture root is the one real decision here
//!
//! A vix program reaches the filesystem through an ORIGIN ADAPTER, and the only
//! one that exists today is the harness's [`FixtureStore`] — which serves trees
//! from `<root>/trees/<name>` and a package registry from `<root>/registry`.
//! So `fixture_tree("x")` in a file run by this shim reads `<root>/trees/x`,
//! where `<root>` defaults to the directory containing the `.vix` file and is
//! overridable with `--fixtures`.
//!
//! That naming is inherited, not chosen: a production embedding would declare
//! its own constant surface (`workspace()`, say) over its own origin adapter
//! through the same seam — `ConstantSurfaceDecl` + `PrimitiveServices::with_origin`
//! — and `vix-core` would learn nothing new. Until such a surface exists, this
//! shim borrows the harness's rather than inventing a second one to maintain.
