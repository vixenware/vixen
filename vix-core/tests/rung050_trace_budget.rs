//! Rung 050 harness substrate — deliberately red checkpoint.
//!
//! This file is committed BEFORE the implementation of first-class
//! `TraceCheck` construction/evaluation and enforceable `#[test]` budgets. It
//! proves the two capabilities are absent today and pins the exact target
//! surface the substrate must reach:
//!
//!   1. Trace checks fail at the surface. `scheduler_requests_at_most`,
//!      `memo_entries_at_most`, and `store_interns_at_most` are unknown check
//!      constructors, so a test that yields one does not compile.
//!   2. Budget syntax is absent. `#[test { budget_wall: 5s, budget_rss: 256MB }]`
//!      carries unit-bearing literals the surface cannot lex, so the canonical
//!      rung 050 file does not compile.
//!
//! The rung 050 fixture itself only needs this substrate to *compile*; running
//! its 10M-iteration fused tail loop is a later checkpoint (tail-call fusion is
//! out of scope here). Trace-check *evaluation* is therefore proven on small
//! substrate fixtures whose value checks complete in-process, and budget
//! *enforcement* is proven by the outer watchdog runner in later milestones.
//!
//! Every assertion below targets the post-implementation behaviour, so each
//! test is red until the substrate lands. It references only already-public
//! API so the test binary still builds (the redness is runtime, not a build
//! break).
