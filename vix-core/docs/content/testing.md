The conformance ladder (`vix/tests/ratchet/`) is written against this page and
the normative language/runtime specifications.

Tests in vix are values, like everything else. A test describes checks; running
tests means demanding them; a failure is an ordinary value that says what went
wrong. There is no test framework in the usual sense — no runner lifecycle your
code hooks into, no setup or teardown ordering, no shared mutable fixtures
*because there is no shared mutable anything*.

There is also no test-specific syntax. A test is an ordinary function.

## Declaring a test

```vix
#[test]
fn point_fields_are_independent() -> Stream<Check> {
    let p = Point { x: 3, y: 4 };
    yield expect_eq(p.x, 3);
    yield expect_eq(Point { x: p.x, ..p }, p);
}
```

A test is a function returning `Stream<Check>` — a generator. `#[test]` marks it;
attributes are the same surface that carries decode annotations, so tests cost no
new grammar. Running a test means demanding its checks.

`vx test` demands every test in scope. `vx test point_fields` demands one. A test
nobody demands costs nothing, like everything else described and not asked for.

In-language test options are attribute fields:

```vix
#[test { budget_wall: 5s, budget_rss: 1GB }]
fn molten_accumulator() -> Stream<Check> { … }
```

## A test's parameters are what the harness supplies

A test that runs a process needs a capability, and a program may not go looking for
one — nothing in a program observes the world. So it **declares** what it needs, and
the harness, which stands outside the program, supplies it:

```vix
#[test]
fn exec_echo(sh: Sh) -> Stream<Check> {
    let out = exec sh`echo "hello ratchet"`;
    yield expect_eq(out.stdout.decode(Utf8).text().trim(), "hello ratchet");
}
```

This is the same act as `vx build --target` defaulting to the host: the demand root
supplies an input. An ambient read is an observation; an input is a pin.

It also means the harness may **forge** a capability — hand the test a fake `Sh`
whose outputs are fixtures — which is how you test an exec without a toolchain.

And using a tool you did not declare is not a special error. It is an **unbound
identifier**: `exec cc`…`` cannot resolve `cc` unless `cc: Cc` is a parameter. The
language has nothing to say about undeclared capabilities because it cannot express
one.

## Checks are values

```vix
expect (cond: Bool) -> Check
expect_eq (pair: (T, T)) -> Check         // any T: everything is comparable
expect_ne (pair: (T, T)) -> Check
expect_some (o: Option<T>) -> Check
expect_none (o: Option<T>) -> Check
expect_snapshot (pair: (T, String)) -> Check
```

Each of these takes **one** subject argument (see [Calling](/vix/calling)):
`expect_eq (a, b)` juxtaposes `expect_eq` with the group `(a, b)`, and the comma
makes that group the pair `(a, b)` — so at-most-one-positional holds without
ceremony. `expect_snapshot (value, "name")` is the same shape: one pair of the
value and its stable snapshot name.

A failing `expect_eq` renders both sides — structurally, for any type, because
every value is serializable; you never write a `Debug` impl to earn diagnostics.
A failure carries the check's stable source site and reports the current source
span. `expect_snapshot` renders its value the same way — structurally, never via
a `Debug` impl — under the pair's `String` name.

`Check` is `must_use`. Constructing one and forgetting to yield it produces a
compiler warning rather than a test that silently passes. The ratchet harness
denies that warning; ordinary users choose whether warnings are promoted to
errors.

**Coming from Rust/JS**: assertions don't throw or panic — a `Check` is a value
(pass, or failure-with-context). Every check in a test is evaluated; you get every
failure in one run, not the first one followed by silence.

## Testing what must not happen

Some of vix's most important promises are about absence: this arm was never taken,
that expensive value was never computed, this process ran once. Nothing *inside* a
program can observe evaluation — that's the point — so these are claims the harness
makes, holding the demand trace from outside.

They need no special syntax either, and the reason is the deepest fact in the
language:

```vix
#[test]
fn partial_dependency_skips_expensive() -> Stream<Check> {
    let p = Point { x: cheap(), y: expensive() };
    yield expect_eq(p.x + 1, 42);
    yield never_demanded (expensive());
    yield demanded (cheap());
}
```

`never_demanded(expensive())` is an ordinary function call. Passing an expression
*describes* a value; it does not compute one. So the check can hold `expensive()`
without ever putting it in a demanded position, and the harness compares that
description against what evaluation actually did.

```
demanded(expr)          — this value was demanded at least once
never_demanded(expr)    — it was not, transitively, ever
demanded_once(expr)     — exactly once (memoization checks)
demanded_times(f) where { times: n }  — f was demanded exactly n times, over any arguments
```

The first three are **value-level**: they pin *which* demand you mean.
`demanded_once (costly 1)` says more than "`costly` ran once." The last is
name-level, for when you mean any call at all — it takes a function value.

The harness also speaks about the run as a whole: `never_read path`,
`memo_hits_at_least n`, `ran_processes n`, `overlapped()`, `killed stage`, and
`finished_before consumer where { producer }`.

## Checks come in two kinds, and the order you yield them is not real

**Generators do not yield in yield order.**

```vix
#[test]
fn ordering_is_not_what_you_think() -> Stream<Check> {
    yield slow_check();      // may arrive second
    yield fast_check();      // may arrive first
}
```

A stream's order is *availability* order. Each check keeps its own identity — a
generator's elements are keyed by where they were described — but **nothing about
the source position of a `yield` determines when it arrives.** This is the single most surprising thing in the
language for a reader coming from any other generator, and it is load-bearing: it
is what lets the harness report failures the instant they are known, and it is why
a stream is not a lazy list.

It also means a claim about the *whole run* cannot be evaluated where you wrote
it. So `Check` is two things, and it says so:

```vix
enum Check {
    Value(ValueCheck),     // expect_eq, expect_some — demanded during the run
    Trace(TraceCheck),     // never_demanded, overlapped — a claim about the finished run
}
```

The harness drains the stream — which constructs every `Check` and demands nothing
— then demands the `Value` checks, and only then the `Trace` checks against the
completed trace. **You never order them; the variant does.** Yield them wherever
they read best.

And that is what makes `never_demanded(expensive())` work. Function arguments
are wires, so a trace-check constructor can identify the described invocation
without reading its result. These are harness intrinsics, not a general
reflection type:

```vix
fn never_demanded<T>(described: T) -> Check
fn demanded_times<A, R>(f: fn(A) -> R) where { times: Int } -> Check
```

Writing `expensive()` in argument position passes its wire; the trace intrinsic
records its recipe/location description without consuming the value.
`expect_eq(expensive(), 1)` constructs a value check whose payload consumes `T`,
so demanding that check demands both sides. There is no user-visible
`Demand<T>`/promise wrapper.

**Coming from Rust/Python/JS**: your generator resumes where it left off and
yields in program order. This one does not. If you write code that depends on
yield position, it is wrong in a way that will pass on your laptop.

## Compile-fail tests

A language's rejections are half its meaning. A test file whose name ends in
`.reject.vix` must *fail* to compile, and declares what the compiler must say:

```vix
//! reject: expression statement
//! at: 4

fn f(state: State) -> State {
    state.domains.with (k, v);   // value goes nowhere — not a sentence
    state
}
```

Compile-fail cannot live in-language, so these keep their headers. The runner
compiles the file, expects failure, and matches the diagnostic. A reject file that
compiles is a failing test.

Compile-warning contracts use `.warn.vix` files with parallel metadata:

```vix
//! warn: unused result of `+`
//! at: 5

fn unchanged(xs: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    let ignored = xs + 4;
    xs
}
```

The file must compile and emit the declared warning at the declared line. The
ratchet treats a missing warning as a failed certificate; it does not change the
language-level diagnostic into an unconditional error.

A test spanning modules names its library files with a `//! uses:` directive:

```vix
//! uses: lib/geometry.vix

import geometry::{Point, magnitude_sq};
```

Each named file is presented to the compiler as the module its file stem names
(`lib/geometry.vix` is the module `geometry`). The harness consumes `uses:`
lines before compiling — they are orchestration, not source — so `//! at:`
line numbers in reject headers refer to the file as compiled, with its `uses:`
lines removed.

Vix source can keep the module namespace instead of importing individual names:

```vix
//! uses: lib/geometry.vix

mod geometry;

fn squared_length(p: geometry::Point) -> Int {
    geometry::magnitude_sq(p)
}
```

`mod geometry;` declares that an externally supplied source is available for
qualified access; it does not itself read a file. The host or test harness is
still responsible for presenting the named module source to the compiler.

Fixture selection, rerun mutations, alternate source files, and expected harness
flags are likewise file-level harness metadata when they describe orchestration
rather than a Vix value. They remain leading `//!` directives until the ratchet
gains an adjacent typed Styx manifest; they are not language statements.

## The ratchet

The conformance suite (`vix/tests/ratchet/`) is a numbered ladder, ordered so that
each rung uses only surface introduced at or below it. `vx test --ratchet` reports
the highest rung *N* such that every rung ≤ *N* passes — the ratchet never counts
a green rung above a red one. Rung 100 is a working miniature of
[the solver chapter](/building-a-solver). When rung 100 is green, the language
in this book exists. Rungs 101 and up say it is good.
