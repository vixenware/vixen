## The story this chapter must explain

You pass a tree — say, a source directory of three hundred files — to a
build step. The build runs, and the machine observes that it read sixty of
those files. Tomorrow the tree is different: someone touched a README the
build never looked at.

What should happen is a two-step dance:

1. **"Is the whole thing the same?"** Ask for the tree's stable content
   identity (its Merkle root). If it matches yesterday's, reuse the
   output with no further questions. One comparison.
2. **"Fine — is the part you *used* the same?"** The whole-tree identity
   differs, so consult what yesterday's run *recorded*: "of that tree, I
   read these sixty files, and here are their hashes." Check those sixty
   against today's tree — cheap, because Merkle trees make per-path
   lookups cheap. All sixty unchanged? Reuse the output. The README was
   never your problem.

Two opportunities for early cutoff: one coarse and O(1), one fine and
proportional to what was actually used. This is the concrete thing vix
does that Nix structurally cannot: Nix has step 1 only — whole-input hash
or nothing. Step 2 requires *observed read-sets*, and observation is the
machine's founding move.

But there is a question hiding inside step 2, and it stays hidden until the
dance is formalized: **when the input changed, how is yesterday's entry found
at all?** The memo key contains the input's content
hash. The content changed. The key changed. By content alone, yesterday's
run is unfindable — the very entry whose read-set we need is filed under a
name we no longer know. Candidate nomination was hand-waved everywhere
this dance was described, and it is the load-bearing missing piece.

## The answer: a value has three identities, not two

The foundation chapter established two planes: **recipe identity** (what
would be computed — the operation plus its inputs' content identities) and
**value identity** (what came out — schema plus content hash). The dance
needs a third, and it is the one that stays stable while the other two
churn:

- **Location** — *where this value lives in the demand graph.* The path
  from the demand root down to this computation, built recursively from
  the location hashes of the path above — never from anyone's content.
  "The rustc invocation for this crate in this workspace's build," as a
  hash. Stable across input changes, across runs, across weeks.
- **Recipe** — *what would be computed here.* Operation identity combined
  with input value identities. Changes whenever any input's content
  changes.
- **Content** — *what came out.* `(SchemaRef, blake3)` of the result.
  Exists only after evaluation, at which point it is trivial: the value is
  materialized, hash its contents.

The memo store is **indexed by location** and **carries** recipe, read-set,
and result. The dance, re-told precisely: walk to the location (known
before evaluating anything — see below). Does an entry there have our
exact recipe? Exact hit; done. No? Do any entries there have a recorded
read-set that re-verifies against today's world? Projection hit; done.
Otherwise evaluate, and file what we observe — at this location, for the
next run to find.

## The law that makes the location plane safe: nomination, never validation

The location hash **nominates** candidates; it never **validates** reuse.
Validation is always content-grounded — recipe equality, or read-by-read
re-verification of a recorded read-set, verified never trusted. A wrong or
unstable location function therefore costs *performance only*: missed
candidates mean spurious rebuilds; bloated candidate sets mean wasted
verification. It can never serve a stale value.

This one law is what makes the whole plane buildable. It puts the location
function on the same footing as the island partition: an implementation-
plane choice, *chosen not commanded*, revisable as the cost model learns,
shippable as a v1 heuristic with a diagnostic. There is no ceremony about
changing it and no need to get it right the first time — because it cannot
be wrong in the direction that matters. Contrast the content plane: its
definition is part of the language, and changing it invalidates every
stored hash. The two planes have opposite change economics, and that is by
design.

## Why locations are computable at all: the demand-time property

A location would be useless if computing it required evaluating the thing
it names. It doesn't, and the reason is structural: **a demand's location
is known at demand time.** When evaluation reaches a call site, the path
taken from the root to here is already in hand — before the subtree below
is evaluated, which is exactly the moment the cache should be consulted.
Locations are *recorded* during the first run the same way read-sets are,
and recomputed incrementally top-down on later runs. Observed, not
declared, like everything else. Static analysis can only improve how
*early* a location is known (prefetching); it is not load-bearing.

## What goes in a path: names, not bodies

If locations incorporated the *content* of the functions along the path,
editing a function's body would relocate everything demanded beneath it —
every downstream nomination would miss, and the warm cache would go cold
precisely when early cutoff should shine. So paths are built from
**names**: the function's name, not its lowered bits.

Follow the consequence through the chapter's own stdlib example: edit a
standard-library function's body. Its recipe changes, so it recomputes.
Its output value comes back identical. Every downstream demand sits at an
*unchanged location* with an *unchanged recipe* — exact hits all the way
down. One node recomputed; the location plane is the mechanism that
*finds* the entries the two-plane story said would be reused.

The price: renames and structural refactors (an extra wrapper in the call
path) churn locations below them — a one-time cold rebuild, correctness
intact. We accept this. There are physical limits to what can be done
here, and machinery to outsmart them (compiler-proved path equivalences)
would be bug-prone and would likely cost more than it saves. The cheap
mitigation that *is* safe: when a full path misses, **nominate by suffix**
— any prior entry whose path ends the same way is a candidate, and
verification decides, as it always does. No proofs; the verifier does the
correctness work; the nominator is allowed to be merely good.

## Fan-out: key by the input's position

`xs.map(f)` issues one demand per element. Same function, same call site,
N times — what disambiguates the locations? Not the element's *content*
(that forces evaluation, and the point is to know locations first). Not
the *output's* position (derived aggregates observe in canonical value
order; output position is rank, which depends on everyone's content). The
answer is the **input's** position: an array is a struct whose fields are
named 0, 1, 2 — so element *i* already has a content-free location,
`location(xs) ⊕ field i`, and the per-element demand is located at
`(call site, that location)`.

Locations then *flow through derivations*: the element of `ys` that came
from `xs[i]` carries its origin, so a further `ys.map(g)` chains off it —
even across `sorted()` or canonical reordering, because an element's
location is where it *came from*, not where it now sits. Location is
provenance, literally. (This is the problem React makes users solve by
hand-writing `key=` — the framework can't see provenance. We can; the
dataflow is the program.)

## Not every demand has a useful location — and that's a classification, not a failure

A convergence loop feeds its own output back. Its iterations have no input
position; disambiguating them by depth is possible but smells wrong — and
the smell is informative. Ask what nomination-by-location would *buy* such
a demand: "same place, different content" is the situation the location
plane serves — stable structure, varying data. A trajectory demand is the
opposite: its content *is* its structure. The reuse it wants — "I have
seen this exact state before" — is content-level dedup, which the memo
already does with no location at all (and which is how solver warm facts
already key: by premise content, position-free).

So demands come in two classes, and the store indexes them differently:

- **Structure-anchored**: arguments carry stable locations (positional
  fields, names, provenance coordinates). Indexed on the location plane;
  eligible for the full nomination dance.
- **Trajectory-born**: arguments exist only as evolving content. Indexed
  by content only — exact recipe dedup, no projection-by-place, because
  "place" is not a meaningful notion for them.

Most of a build graph is structure-anchored. Most of a solver's interior
is trajectory-born — and is *also* mostly not demands at all (interior
iteration is molten, one island, one edge). The classification costs
nothing and spends effort where it pays.

## External inputs: provenance coordinates

Values that enter from outside the program need locations too, and theirs
come from provenance: a watched tree on a developer's machine is located
at (daemon installation UUID, local path); a registry crate at (registry,
package, version). Content-free, stable, and exactly the vocabulary the
receipts and journal already speak — the location plane is where "this
came from *that* laptop" was always going to live.

## The store this implies is not a dumb KV

A hundred thousand prior runs must be queryable by location, including
suffix matches, without scanning. The shapes (directional, not final):

- **Nomination index: a trie over reversed paths.** Locations are name
  sequences; index them leaf-first, and longest-suffix matching is a walk
  proportional to path length, not store size. Exact hits are the full
  walk; candidate sets are bounded by per-node retention policy — a cost
  knob, never a soundness knob.
- **Verification stamps: the red-green move.** Every entry carries the
  world-version at which its read-set last verified. The daemon owns the
  delta stream, so "did anything this entry read change since?" is an
  intersection of the entry's read-set with the changed-coordinates set —
  not a re-walk of the world. Nothing relevant changed since the stamp →
  accept in O(1). Merkle roots short-circuit hierarchically.
- **Filters for the intersection.** Read-sets and delta-sets as
  approximate-membership filters, false positives triggering a real
  verification (the safe direction). Candidate structure: ribbon filters
  or successors — to be grounded, not assumed.

How this sits against prior art:

- **Nomination-never-validation is not new here** — the store design
  already specified the tiered lookup order (local exact → persistent
  exact → local projection → persistent projection, each verified →
  spawn); what no design specified was how a projection candidate is
  *found*. The location plane fills that hole.
- **Names-not-bodies already exists twice in this system**, reached
  independently: exec mounts at role-stable paths (content-derived paths
  would leak the world into the identity) and capability *names* rather
  than indices in lowered programs (survives registry reordering across
  reload). Same doctrine, third layer.
- **Nominal Adapton** proved the thesis: names distinct from content,
  used only to find reuse candidates, with correctness enforced elsewhere.
  Its allocation mechanism doesn't transfer — Adapton's names are
  programmer-allocated and opt-in (explicit name-forking through loops),
  which "no programmer draws islands" rules out on principle. Vix's
  derivation is automatic and structural (call site + input position),
  and must be.
- **Salsa's durability stamps solve a different sub-problem than the
  trie**: they make re-verifying a dependency edge *you already have*
  O(1); Salsa never needed nomination because its query keys are exact.
  Here the trie *finds* the candidate; the stamp makes *confirming* it
  cheap. Complementary mechanisms.
- **Skyframe's SkyKey** proves stable nominal keys work at production
  build-graph scale — but it conflates nomination and validation in one
  key and has no fallback when the exact key misses: a renamed target is
  an unrecoverable cache miss. The suffix-match fallback is exactly what
  it lacks. Watchman's clockspec is the clean precedent for the
  daemon-owned monotonic delta stream.
- **Ribbon filters** (Dillinger & Walzer 2021) fit the
  false-positives-are-safe direction precisely. The scale argument for a
  probabilistic structure is real but must be earned: the one worked
  analog of this intersection problem in vix's own design history — the
  solver's premise→facts invalidation index — chose an *exact* structure,
  at a scale where exact is free (a learned fact rests on one or two
  premises). The build-graph target is a hundred thousand runs, two to
  three orders larger; where the crossover sits is a measurement, not an
  argument.
- **New territory, confirmed by absence**: the content-free path identity
  for demand-graph nodes, suffix matching as fallback nomination (no
  build system or paper does it — the nearest relative is GreenTrie's
  constraint-entailment caching, a different domain), and the
  reversed-path trie as nomination index.

## Initial nomination policy

V0 keeps the full content-free location path and nominates only an exact path.
It performs no path compression, suffix nomination, trajectory classification,
or depth hinting. The memo stores the path beside its digest and compares it
after lookup; a location-hash collision is therefore a cold miss, never a reuse
proof.

Compression, suffix ranking, and trajectory hints remain admissible cost-model
experiments only after exact nomination has counters at corpus scale. They get a
cost-model epoch and can change which prior entry is tried first, but they never
enter recipe or value identity and never validate reuse. This is a default and
an authority boundary, not an unresolved semantic choice.
