This chapter follows Rodin, whose normative solver specification lives at
[/rodin](/rodin).

You want to build a dependency solver. Given manifests and a package
index, pick one version per package so every requirement holds — an
NP-hard search problem with a folklore reputation: you'll need a
propagation engine, a backtracking scheme with undo machinery, conflict
learning if you want it fast, a persistence layer if you want it warm
across runs, and cache invalidation if you want the persistence to not
lie. In most stacks that's an engine project before it's a solver.

This chapter builds one in vix, and the point of the chapter is what you
*don't* build.

## The world as demanded values

A solver consumes an index: which versions of which packages exist, and
what each depends on. The index is enormous and remote — and that's fine,
because describing it costs nothing:

```vix
fn index_row(registry: Registry) where { pkg: PkgName, version: Version } -> Row {
    parse_row (fetch (registry.row_url pkg where { version }))
}
```

Nothing is fetched here. Rows are fetched when the search demands them —
and only the rows the search actually visits. A solve that touches 200
packages of a 150,000-package index performs 200 fetches, memoized, and
you wrote no cache: results of `fetch` and `parse_row` are values, and
values are cached by the machine under their identity. The second solve
of the day fetches nothing at all.

## Solver state is a value

```vix
struct State {
    domains:  Map<PkgId, VersionSet>,   // versions still possible, per package
    selected: Map<PkgId, Version>,      // decisions made so far
    learned:  Set<NoGood>,              // conflicts we've understood
}
```

Propagation shrinks domains until nothing changes or a contradiction
appears:

```vix
enum Step { Pass(State), Conflict(NoGood) }

fn propagate(state: State) where { row: Row } -> Step {
    row.deps.values().fold(Step::Pass(state), |step, dep| {
        match step {
            Step::Conflict(ng) => Step::Conflict(ng),
            Step::Pass(s) => {
                let narrowed = s.domains.get(dep.pkg).intersect(dep.req);
                if narrowed.is_empty() {
                    Step::Conflict(no_good_for s where { dep })
                } else {
                    Step::Pass(State {
                        domains: s.domains.with (dep.pkg, narrowed),
                        ..s
                    })
                }
            },
        }
    })
}
```

Ordinary code: a fold, a map `with`, a record spread. Each step denotes a
fresh `State`. Hold that thought.

## Backtracking is free

Here's where the folklore engine evaporates. Search tries a candidate,
descends, and — on conflict — must *undo* everything the failed branch
did. Imperative solvers maintain trails: logs of every mutation, replayed
backwards on backtrack, with unit-tested undo for every kind of change.
It's the most delicate code in any CDCL engine.

```vix
fn search(state: State) -> Outcome {
    match pick_undecided(state) {
        None => Outcome::Solved(state.selected),
        Some(pkg) => try_candidates state where { pkg, cands: candidates state where { pkg } },
    }
}

fn try_candidates(state: State) where { pkg: PkgId, cands: [Version] } -> Outcome {
    match cands.split_last() {
        None => Outcome::Exhausted(no_good_for_exhaustion state where { pkg }),
        Some((v, rest)) => match attempt state where { pkg, version: v } {
            Outcome::Solved(sel) => Outcome::Solved(sel),
            Outcome::Exhausted(ng) =>
                try_candidates (learn state where { ng }) where { pkg, cands: rest },
            //              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ backtracking is THIS:
            //              we still have `state`. The failed branch's
            //              hundred domain-narrowings belong to a value
            //              we simply stopped using.
        },
    }
}
```

There is no trail. There is no undo. `attempt` built new states from
`state`; when the branch fails, `state` — untouched, because nothing
touches anything — is right there to try the next candidate from. The
entire undo subsystem of a classical solver exists to *simulate*, with
mutation plus bookkeeping, what a by-value language just has.

## Learning is just values

A `NoGood` — "these choices can never coexist, and here's why" — is a
record. Learning is `state.learned` growing through the fold above;
consulting learned facts is propagation reading them. No arena, no clause
database with reference counting, no watch lists to maintain under undo
(the states they'd be undone *to* still exist).

And warm restarts — reusing learned facts across solves, the feature that
turns nightly resolution from minutes to milliseconds — is the machine's
memoization applied to the derivations that produced the facts. A learned
fact rests on what it read (index rows, and crucially *absences* — "no
version of X in range Y exists", recorded as first-class observations).
Tomorrow, facts whose reads still hold are reusable; facts invalidated by
a new publish simply fail re-verification and are re-derived. You build
none of this. The persistence chapter of a solver README is, here, a
property of the substrate. The details are in
[the three planes of identity](/three-planes).

## Incremental for free, exact by construction

Someone bumps one requirement in one manifest. What re-runs? Exactly the
demands whose inputs changed: the affected package's clauses, the
propagation that read them, the search regions that depended on those
domains. The unaffected 90% of yesterday's solve — including its fetches,
parses, and learned facts — are cache hits *proven* by recorded reads,
not guessed by timestamps. You did not design an incremental solver. You
wrote `solve`, and incrementality is what evaluation means here.

## What you didn't build

A fetch cache. A parse cache. An undo trail. A clause database. A
persistence format for learned facts. An invalidation scheme for that
persistence. An incremental-recompute engine. A parallelism strategy
(independent branches and independent fetches parallelize under the
machine's scheduling — by-value state has no locks to take).

What you did build: the actual solver — domains, propagation, selection,
learning. About fifteen hundred lines in the real one. It's called rodin,
it resolves real Cargo workspaces against the real crates.io index and
matches `cargo tree` on the fixtures that count, and its specification is
at [/rodin](/rodin). This chapter is its postcard.
