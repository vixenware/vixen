Memoization: keys, hit economics, and the three-tier verified-reuse ladder
preserved from the current driver (the part of the old machine that was
right).

> r[machine.memo.indexed-by-location]
>
> [DESIGN, round 10 — the rule round 5 promised and never wrote] **The memo is
> INDEXED by location**, not by content. A location is the path of *names* from the
> demand root: content-free, known at demand time, and unchanged when a file's
> bytes change.
>
> A `DemandKey` (`machine.memo.demand-key`) is a digest over argument *content*
> hashes. If it were the index, the two-step dance could not happen: the input
> changed, so the key changed, so yesterday's entry — the very one whose read-set we
> need — is filed under a name we no longer know. `three-planes.md` argues this by
> name, and until now no rule reflected it.
>
> So: **the index is the location; `DemandKey` is a field of the entry.** An entry
> carries `(recipe identity, read-set, result)`. Lookup nominates by location, then
> validates: an exact `DemandKey` match is a tier-1 hit; otherwise the read-set is
> checked against the world (tier-2), and a change that misses the read-set reuses
> the result. This is why editing a file nobody read invalidates nothing, and it is
> what `machine.placement.trees-cross-as-grants` depends on.
>
> Nomination is never validation: a bad location costs a recompute, never a stale
> answer, so the location function is cost-model plane and freely revisable.

> r[machine.memo.demand-key]
>
> [DESIGN] A `DemandKey` is a fixed-size digest formed by a
> framed combine of the closure identity and argument identities (each argument
> identity is the pair `(SchemaRef, ContentHash)`, per
> `machine.identity.value-identity-pair`), computed once at demand entry. It is the
> **recipe identity** carried on a memo entry — NOT the memo's index
> (`machine.memo.indexed-by-location`). The
> heap-allocated tuple key and its per-lookup element hashing are banned. To
> prevent a digest collision serving a wrong value, each memo entry also
> carries the exact key preimage `(closure identity, arity,
> [(SchemaRef, ContentHash)])`, and exact lookup compares the preimage after
> the digest map hit. An implementation that instead relies on blake3
> collision-resistance must state that as its trust assumption and reject
> untrusted persistent exact claims unless policy permits it.

> r[machine.memo.no-recompute-at-lookup]
>
> [DESIGN] Memo lookup reads stored identity slots
> (`machine.identity.hash-at-construction`). Canonicalizing or hashing
> arguments at lookup time is banned — the memoizer must not pay identity
> recomputation as its entry fee.

> r[machine.memo.allocation-free-hits]
>
> [SETTLED] A memo hit is allocation-free: borrowed or Arc'd returns.
> `.cloned()` on the hit path has its economics backwards.

> r[machine.memo.three-tier-reuse]
>
> [DESIGN] Warm reuse tries three tiers in order — exact (key equality),
> projection (a prior entry whose recorded read-set re-verifies against the
> current arguments), semantic (declared per-argument comparator functions,
> themselves demanded/memoized) — then spawns. Each tier emits its own event
> with a `verified` count. (Preserved from `Driver::demand`.)

> r[machine.memo.verified-reuse]
>
> [SETTLED] Reuse is verified, never trusted-on-record: a projection hit
> re-checks every recorded read against the current world before serving. An
> entry with an empty read-set is never a projection candidate. Verification
> against an under-recorded read-set is unsound in the dangerous direction —
> it serves stale values — which is why read-set completeness is structural
> (`machine.receipt.witness-reads`), not conventional. The reads the machine
> performs TO re-verify a candidate are machine-meta operations and are not
> themselves recorded into any receipt (they are not the demanded
> computation's reads).

> r[machine.memo.receipt-remap]
>
> [DESIGN] A memo hit contributes the cached entry's read-set to the CALLER's
> receipt (the caller depended on everything the cached computation read). This
> remapping is what keeps receipts complete across nested reuse. Exact hits
> stay allocation-free (`machine.memo.allocation-free-hits`) by pre-materializing
> the exposable read-set value at miss time, so the hit path only references
> it. (Preserved from the driver's nested-hit read-set remapping.)

> r[machine.memo.hit-carries-receipt]
>
> [DESIGN] A memo hit exposes the original entry's receipt (read-set), not
> just the cached value. Consumers — test selection, audit mode, widening —
> need "why is this reusable," not a bare boolean. (Testing-as-demand: an
> unchanged test is a cache hit that carries its receipt, never a heuristic
> skip.)

> r[machine.memo.effect-results]
>
> [SETTLED] Effect (primitive) results are memo entries keyed by their demand,
> under the primitive's declared memo policy. Private effect caches are
> banned (`machine.cache.no-private-caches`).

> r[machine.memo.rerun-audit]
>
> [DESIGN] The machine can re-run a memoized node and diff its result and
> read-set against the recorded entry. This one capability serves audit mode
> (statistical re-verification of memoized tests), flakiness detection
> (diverging read-sets or results under identical inputs are machine-detected
> facts, not folklore), and tier-2 style re-verification generally.
