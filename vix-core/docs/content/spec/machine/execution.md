Execution authority: weavy owns running code; the machine consumes lowering
artifacts and never second-guesses the substrate.

> r[machine.execution.weavy-owns-mode]
>
> [SETTLED] Weavy owns the interp/JIT decision as the single authority. The
> machine holds no Interp/Jit enum, no private cfg, no mode plumbing — it
> hands Weavy a program and receives execution or typed fault facts. Vix and
> every other consumer do not select, implement, or bypass the execution lane
> or checked-execution mode.

> r[machine.execution.jit-single-feature]
>
> [SETTLED] There is exactly ONE jit feature in the ecosystem: weavy's. vix,
> phon, and every other weavy consumer carry no jit feature of their own — the
> per-crate `#[cfg(feature = "jit")]` gates that caused the dependency-position
> `Op` build break are abolished. Weavy's `jit` feature is the master switch
> and is default-on for normal desktop/server builds. Cargo positive features
> are additive, so a dependency graph can enable that feature transitively; the
> dominant global OFF switch is Weavy's own negative build policy
> `WEAVY_JIT=0`, read only by Weavy. The policy may disable JIT, but it never
> widens the Cargo feature or target matrix. The build predicate is
> `jit_active = feature_enabled ∧ policy_allows ∧ target_supports_copy_patch`:
> OFF means off for good, nothing downstream can turn JIT on against it; ON
> means on only where the platform supports executable memory. Mechanism:
>
> - Weavy's build script computes `jit_active` from `CARGO_FEATURE_JIT`,
>   `WEAVY_JIT`, `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS`, and `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH`.
>   `WEAVY_JIT` unset or `1` allows the feature/matrix decision; `WEAVY_JIT=0`
>   denies it; any other value is a build error. The target predicate is the
>   copy-patch backend's explicit supported `(OS, architecture)` matrix:
>   macOS/aarch64 and Linux/x86_64. W^X-locked targets
>   (iOS/tvOS/watchOS/visionOS) and unsupported architectures force it off even
>   when the feature and policy are on. Weavy emits `weavy_jit_active` only
>   when active, and always emits explicit `cargo::metadata=jit=1` or
>   `cargo::metadata=jit=0` through `links = "weavy"`. Every direct dependent's
>   build script compares `DEP_WEAVY_JIT` to exactly `1`; presence alone is not
>   active. A dependent may additionally narrow the matrix further for its own
>   stencils, e.g. phon-jit only ships macos-aarch64 ones today, but never widen
>   it.
> - The JIT API surface is always compiled; only the copy-patch runtime
>   executor and the build-time stencil extraction are behind `jit_active`.
>   Consumers compile unconditionally and check
>   `NATIVE_COPY_PATCH_AVAILABLE` at runtime.
> - With Weavy's Cargo feature disabled, optional copy-patch dependencies and
>   build work should be avoided wherever Cargo can express that soundly. When
>   the feature is enabled but the policy or target matrix makes
>   `jit_active = false`, builds must at least skip stencil extraction and the
>   native executor, and must not compile W+X/native execution code. This is not
>   a promise that Cargo can prune every cross-target dependency edge.
>
> This means an iOS build (or any target outside the matrix) falls to the
> interpreter by construction — no W+X/native executor compiled, no per-crate
> feature — while a desktop/server build on a matrix-supported target JITs by
> default without an app-root feature dance. A graph-wide disable is expressed
> as Weavy policy (`WEAVY_JIT=0`), not by trying to defeat Cargo feature
> unification with downstream `default-features = false` choreography.
> (Rationale: compiling ordinary dependency crates may still be Cargo-visible
> build-time waste, but compiling or running copy-patch executable machinery is
> controlled by Weavy's predicate; the matrix itself is a correctness
> constraint, not a portability nicety.)

> r[machine.execution.verified-admission]
>
> [SETTLED] A raw Weavy `Program` is inert architecture-neutral construction
> data. Every interpreter spawn, JIT compilation, and native execution entry
> point accepts only an opaque `VerifiedProgram` produced by one always-on Weavy
> verifier. There is no unchecked public constructor and no public consumer
> path that can run or compile raw program bytes.
>
> The lowering artifact carries the proof material the verifier needs. In
> particular, the architecture-neutral `Program` includes a compact frame
> contract/manifest: declared regions with offset, width, alignment, and
> machine kind/schema witness sufficient to verify every op's reads and writes,
> entry bindings, argument copies, indirect-call slots/contracts, and return
> regions. This is not full Vix type reflection and not runtime tagging in the
> fast lane; it is proof material cached with the lowering artifact. Frame
> layout byte bounds alone are insufficient.
>
> A function's concrete entry contract lists every region that may be
> initialized before its first instruction: declared parameters in source ABI
> order, followed by the lowering artifact's deterministic closure-constant
> bindings. Direct calls copy that same sequence, and the root runtime
> materializes constants through the same typed entry accessor; a constant is
> never installed by an unchecked frame-offset write. An indirect call contract
> remains the source-level callable signature. A closure with captured
> constants must represent its environment explicitly before it can satisfy
> that signature; hidden extra indirect-call entries are forbidden.
>
> Every declared entry binding is initialized exactly once through the typed
> accessor for its declared machine kind before the first instruction may run.
> Zero-filled frame storage is not an initialized scalar, handle, callable, or
> constant. A missing binding, duplicate write, or wrong-kind accessor is a
> typed pre-entry fault and does not mutate the frame. The entry surface closes
> permanently when the first drive is attempted; a parked, yielded, completed,
> or faulted task cannot have its initial frame rewritten.
>
> Declared frame regions do not overlap. Several mutually exclusive control-flow
> arms may write the same declared result region; that is one region with
> several verified writers, not an overlay. Verification checks each op's
> accesses against the declared region rather than imposing a single-writer
> rule. A future slot-coalescing allocator must introduce and prove an explicit
> alias contract before its programs are admissible.
>
> Non-discriminated products are structural values too. A verified
> `ProductConstruct` writes one complete product from exactly one source for
> every declared field; a verified `ProductProject` copies one declared field
> into a destination carrying that field's exact shape; and a verified
> `CopyValue` copies one complete value between regions carrying the same
> structural-shape identity. This remains true for one-word products. Raw word
> copies apply only to non-structural scalar leaves: they may not construct a
> product field by field, project a field out of a structural region, or merge
> a structural branch result. Record spread elaborates to typed projections
> followed by one complete product construction; a separate mutation/update
> primitive is not required for correctness.
>
> A zero-word product still has structural-shape identity even though it owns
> no frame bytes. Several zero-word regions may therefore have the same byte
> offset without being aliases. Typed operations, call arguments, and returns
> identify such a value through its declared region and shape identity, not by
> choosing the first region whose `(offset, size)` happens to be `(n, 0)`.
> Unit construction allocates no dummy word and fabricates no padding.
>
> Compact discriminated values add selector-correlated shape facts to that
> manifest. The contract names the enum shape, its compact width and selector
> word, every valid variant, and each variant field's shape and shared-payload
> offset. A verified `EnumConstruct` zeroes the complete compact region, writes
> one statically valid selector, and copies exactly the fields declared for that
> variant. A verified `EnumIsVariant` validates that the live selector names
> some declared variant before comparing it with the requested variant; match
> dispatch and source-level variant tests use this operation rather than reading
> the selector as an unchecked scalar. A verified `EnumProjectChecked` validates
> both that the selector is declared and that it selects the requested variant
> before copying the declared field. An invalid selector or projection mismatch
> is a typed `TaskFault`, never a raw union read or fallthrough into the final
> match arm. Static dominance analysis may later discharge a redundant check,
> but the unchecked lowering pattern is not itself proof.
>
> A selector-correlated payload is not semantically compared as a raw frame
> word. Equality first proves equal valid selectors, dispatches to that variant,
> and compares only its declared fields using each field type's semantic
> equality. Raw `EqI64` and `NeI64` apply only to scalar leaves and selectors;
> handle-backed leaves compare through the checked referent-identity or
> byte-comparison operation (`machine.identity.handle-by-referent`). Calls,

> and identity invariants only; they do not authorize handle-integer equality.
>
> Type-directed equality expansion remains an implementation of the original
> Vix equality node, not a set of synthetic VIR nodes and not one opaque Weavy
> `ValueEq` operation. When compact-enum equality needs checked projections,
> the function layout allocates permanent, non-overlapping typed temporary
> regions for the projected left and right fields. Each temporary carries the
> exact field shape in the frame contract, and every generated projection,

> shared union-shaped scratch region may not impersonate several field shapes.
>
> Verification proves all static safety obligations before any lane executes:
> statically named function, call, and jump targets; function fallthrough;
> immediate and opcode shape; frame offset, width, and alignment using checked
> arithmetic; argument and return copies against the frame contract; declared
> inline regions; host and await requirements; and vocabulary/ABI support for
> the selected platform. For an indirect callee, verification proves the slot's
> machine kind and call contract, not the runtime function id or concrete
> target. The typed access/execution membrane checks both that the dynamic id is
> in range and that the selected function's declared call-contract identity
> equals the contract verified at the call site; either mismatch faults
> identically in every lane.

> Host and await table lengths supplied at drive time are checked against the
> verified program requirements before native code can enter. Weavy reports
> malformed programs as its own typed `ProgramError` and dynamic invariant
> violations as its own typed `TaskFault`, carrying function/op/contract facts.
> Vix wraps those values without stringification into `MachineError` and adds

> r[machine.execution.no-pure-hostcalls]
