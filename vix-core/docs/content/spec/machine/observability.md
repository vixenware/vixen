The observability spine — built first, zero-cost when off, and the reason
"why is it slow" and "why did this rebuild" are queries rather than
campaigns.

> r[machine.obs.event-sink]
>
> [SETTLED] Events flow through a sink trait parameter. A no-op sink inlines
> to nothing — observability is free when off, always available when wanted.
> Unconditional emission on hot paths is banned.

> r[machine.obs.event-vocabulary]
>
> [DESIGN] The demand-event vocabulary preserves the current driver's
> distinctions: demanded, the three memo-hit tiers with verified counts,
> spawned (fn-level and exact-invocation-level separately), parked, completed,
> store-alloc with dedup bit, the exec lifecycle triple carrying the tier
> verdict, generic observations with replay bit, and artifact-probe events
> with their own cache bit. Four reuse axes, four event shapes
> (`machine.arch.reuse-axes-distinct`).

> r[machine.obs.counters]
>
> [DESIGN] Standing counters: hostcalls per inner-loop iteration, scheduler
> requests per iteration, interns per branch, memo hit economics (hits,
> verified-counts, allocation on hit = 0), effect-pool saturation. Counters
> are load-independent attribution — the instrument of record when wall
> clocks lie.

> r[machine.obs.stax]
>
> [DESIGN] Stax sees everything: jitdump/DWARF registration wired for every
> compiled stencil (the mechanism exists in weavy; WIRING it is the rule),
> phase spans at machine boundaries (demand entry, freeze, effect begin/
> complete) as user events. A profile with anonymous regions is a spec
> violation, not a tooling gap.

> r[machine.obs.ir-dump]
>
> [SETTLED] Graph VIR, partitioned VIR, lowered Weavy IR, native mapping tables,
> and the source-map chain have deterministic text plus typed inspection forms.
> A machine whose compiled form cannot be read is unreviewable by construction.

> r[machine.obs.snapshot-no-clone]
>
> [SETTLED] Observability surfaces do not clone the world: a debug/inspection
> snapshot is a view, iterator, or copy-on-write, never an O(store) allocation.
> (L11's observability half; the store half is `machine.store.snapshot-no-clone`.)

> r[machine.obs.loud-fallbacks]
>
> [SETTLED] Every conservative fallback — safe-miss, safe-rebuild, safe-false
> — emits a reasoned event. A receipts system cannot contain a rebuild cause
> that leaves no receipt; "correct but slow" gets the same rigor as "wrong"
> because nothing else ever catches it.

> r[machine.obs.flakiness-detected]
>
> [DESIGN] Nondeterminism is machine-detected: diverging read-sets or results
> on a memo re-run (`machine.memo.rerun-audit`) surface as typed events.
> Flakiness is an observation, not folklore.
