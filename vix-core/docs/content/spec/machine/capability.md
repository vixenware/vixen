The machine-side boundary with capabilities — daemon-advertised toolchains
carrying command grammars. The capability packages themselves (discovery,
fingerprinting, grammars-as-data, the daemon) are `vixen.*` spec territory;
this page covers only what the MACHINE must honor about them.

> r[machine.capability.two-classes]
>
> [SETTLED] Two toolchain classes exist and the machine treats them
> differently. MATERIALIZABLE toolchains (rustc-class) are ordinary
> content-addressed inputs — a-priori identity, hash what you mount, not
> deeply capabilities at all. AMBIENT toolchains (Xcode/MSVC-class — legally
> or technically un-materializable) are capabilities proper: a-posteriori
> identity, daemon-advertised, fingerprinted, continuously re-verified.

> r[machine.capability.fingerprint-in-identity]
>
> [SETTLED] The daemon's advertised fingerprint is the SINGLE source of truth
> for an ambient capability's identity; it enters exec identity and the receipt
> records it. A backend may probe per invocation only to VERIFY the advertised
> fingerprint or to raise a poison event on mismatch — never to silently mint a
> new competing identity. Advertisement is the trust event; the probe is
> verification, not a second authority.

> r[machine.capability.projectability-owned]
>
> [DESIGN] Projectability — which of a value's shapes a capability knows how to
> observe and record — is owned by the capability over `SchemaRef`, not by a
> stringly ontology hardcoded in the machine (the old `is_projectable_schema`
> name-match).

> r[machine.capability.poison-honored]
>
> [SETTLED] When the daemon poisons an in-flight build (the watched toolchain
> mutated underfoot), the machine fails the affected executions loudly and
> does not memoize their results. Advertise ⇒ watch ⇒ poison is what keeps
> receipts honest over toolchains we can only observe; the machine's half of
> the contract is refusing to launder a poisoned run into the memo.

> r[machine.capability.no-argv-dialect]
>
> [SETTLED] The machine knows no tool's argv dialect. Argument roles (input,
> output, search-dir, env) come from the capability's command grammar as
> typed captures; suffix sniffing, mount-prefix sniffing (`starts_with("/m/")`
> deciding semantics), and per-tool match arms in machine code are banned.
> Adding a tool is publishing a grammar.

> r[machine.capability.undeclared-is-loud]
>
> [SETTLED] Use of an undeclared capability is a loud failure (the trap-
> executable mechanism, `machine.primitive.exec-hermetic-traps`). Declaration
> is what makes ambient tooling legitimate; the receipt records the
> declaration and the observed identity.
