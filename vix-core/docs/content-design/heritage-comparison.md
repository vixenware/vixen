title = "heritage: the vixen-era language design vs the book"
+++

Comparison of the previous design round (`~/vixenware/vixen/docs/design/`:
`vix-spec.md` V1–V32, `vix-language-design.md`, `sketches/types.vix.md`,
`tree-sitter-vixen/grammar.js`) against the current book + machine spec.
Three buckets: independently re-derived (convergence = evidence the design
is real), genuinely improved since, and things the old design had that the
new corpus has NOT re-derived — the import candidates, which are the
payload.

## Independently re-derived — the convergences

These were arrived at again this round without consulting the old texts,
sometimes verbatim:

- **Everything hashable, equatable, totally ordered — no derive layer.**
  Old rule: "the language cannot express a type that can't be a memo key."
  V12 even states *"collect yields the canonical total order, never
  arrival order; scheduling nondeterminism is unobservable by
  construction"* — the canonical-order doctrine, word for word, including
  **ordered-float semantics** (re-derived yesterday as ratchet rung 134).
- **Values, not places.** No references, lifetimes, `mut`, `Box`;
  `env.insert(k, v)` returns a new map — the Values chapter, five days
  early.
- **Purity; effects only in primitives; no async surface ever; demand IS
  the await** (V1, V3) — Description-not-action, older phrasing.
- **Nothing forces locally** (V4, with the war note "killed attempts 1–4
  when violated") — the no-in-program-forcing law, banked again in
  changelog round 3 as if new.
- **Projections are free; identity forces** (V5) — partial dependency.
- **Two-tier identity: fingerprint × read-set, the anti-Nix pillar** (V9,
  round 4: "LOAD-BEARING design pillar"), including tier 2 skipping work
  *"even when the tree changed, if changes miss the read-set"* — this IS
  the two-step dance, formalized in the old corpus after all; the piece
  genuinely missing then AND now was candidate nomination, which the
  location plane now supplies.
- **Conservative caching: false positives never** (V8).
- **Capability daemon: advertise ⇒ watch ⇒ poison** (V28); **command
  grammars ride with the capability** (V29); both survived into the
  machine spec near-verbatim.
- **The result pin is the authority; recompute is the audit** (V16) —
  today's `fetch-observation-pin` rule.
- **Pull-based streams where "rustc .rmeta mid-compile → downstream
  fires"** — progressive exec trees, and ratchet rung 128.
- **Iteration** (old round 3): map/filter = parallel fan-out, fold =
  sequential chain, "cost model legible in source" — refined this round
  into the array/multiset type split and names-carry-semantics.
- **One implementation, typed instructions over untagged operands,
  interp==JIT differential incl. suspension traces** (V24) — the weavy
  doctrine and gate discipline.
- **Enforcement-per-invariant** (each V names its harness) — the ratchet's
  ethos; the old spec's §4 "what correct means, mechanically" is the
  foundation contract's ancestor.

## Genuinely improved since

- **Partition-as-filter fixes V11.** Old: "aggregation unit = memo unit" —
  which couples cache keys to the compiler's grouping, so repartitioning
  would strand caches. New: memo keys are partition-independent; the
  partition only filters which values are observed. This is the one place
  the old spec was *wrong* rather than early, and the new design knows why.
- **Islands are a theory where "auto-aggregate via cost heuristics" was a
  hope** — semantic cuts (effects, unprovable demand) vs cost-model cuts,
  the materialized-strictness-analysis argument, no programmer knob.
- **The location plane** — the old two tiers had no stable name for "the
  same computation across runs"; nomination was the unformalized hole.
- **Replay-is-semantics** — old had suspendable nodes and an enumerable
  frontier (V26); new makes restart the semantic model and suspension a
  discardable cache, with the chaos oracle enforcing it.
- **Content-hash definition** (schema-specialized walk, entry-carried
  identity, carried midstate) — deeper than V13's "canonicalized parse,
  everywhere."
- **Spec-as-textbook + the ratchet** — the old spec is an implementer's
  constitution; the new corpus also teaches, and its conformance ladder is
  executable.

## NOT re-derived — import candidates (the payload)

1. **V10, the blast-radius rule — the sharpest missing piece.** "The
   closure hash joins every memo key — covering the canonical ASTs of
   EVERYTHING the code references, transitively: functions AND type
   declarations." Proven live: a warm reload served a stale result after a
   leaf edit; an `#[ignore]`d blast-radius test was written as the fix's
   oracle. The new spec's recipe identity says "operation identity +
   inputs' identities" but never pins what *operation identity* covers —
   transitive callees? referenced type declarations? The old design paid
   blood for the answer. **Needs a rule, and a ratchet rung.**
2. **Observation upgrades.** Pins are addressable; *upgrade = re-evaluate
   while ignoring this observation*. This is the entire
   `cargo update`/lockfile-refresh story in one mechanism, and the new
   journal/receipt rules don't have it.
3. **Cargo.lock as a bidirectional journal backend** (V17) — "imported,
   not imitated"; source of truth, not a view. Product-critical for the
   drop-in wedge; absent from the new persistence spec.
4. **V22: the resolution result is a queryable artifact** — per-node
   derivations, provenance queries as reads, *counterfactuals as ordinary
   re-solves returning diffs + manifest amendments*, UNSAT returns its
   impossibility derivation. This is a decided shape for what the new
   corpus still tracks as the OPEN certificate-vs-derivation question —
   the old answer should at least be on that question's table.
5. **V29's degradation clause**: an argv item the grammar can't parse
   degrades to the widest assumption — *unparseable is slow, never
   unsound*. The new `no-argv-dialect` rule bans sniffing but never states
   the graceful floor.
6. **V25: the vix crate stays WASM-clean** — playground/browser story;
   nothing in the new spec protects it.
7. **Ecosystem closures** (V-vocabulary): the registry *ships vix code*
   (`versions_of` + `deps_of`); the solver doesn't know it's resolving
   crates. Current rodin work does this de facto (index.vix); the framing
   that it's a REGISTRY capability's payload is stronger and unstated.
8. **Prefetch-PGO** ("statistical model from previous runs prewarns tree
   materialization") and **`vix wtf`** (time-travel debugging UI, REPL) —
   product affordances worth keeping on a list somewhere they can be found.

## Divergences needing adjudication

- **RETRACTED after closer reading: generics brackets are NOT a fork.**
  tree-sitter-vixen's `[]` type arguments are an older layer that the
  types sketch (07-04) itself superseded — the sketch writes
  `Pair<Int, String>`, `Map<String, String>`, bans `T?` sugar, and uses
  `..base` spread. The sketch and the book agree on nearly the whole
  surface. The stale-vs-current split inside the OLD corpus is:
  grammar.js carries arrow closures `(x) => e`, pipes `|> _`, postfix `!`
  (invocation) and `?` (fallible), `value with {…}` updates, `${…}`
  interpolation, `is` pattern-tests, `#capability` tags on `Fn` types,
  `[]` generics, `T?` — while the sketch has already moved to the
  Rust-shaped surface the book uses.
- **`import("path")` function-style** (grammar.js) vs the book's bare
  `import geometry::{…}` (ratchet rung 106) — the sketch is silent;
  adjudication still wanted, low stakes.
- **`{}` as the empty-map literal is a book-side invention.** The sketch
  ruled "no map literal syntax v0: `Map::from([(k, v), …])` — boring on
  purpose"; ratchet rung 041 casually wrote `let m: Map<String, Int> = {};`.
  One of these is now the language.
- **Per-field struct defaults were already designed** (`opt: Int = 2` in
  the sketch) — the "go further than Rust" companion decision has prior
  art in-house; import the sketch's shape.
- **Dropped grammar features worth a deliberate verdict rather than
  silence**: `|>` pipelines with `_` placeholder, `${…}` string
  interpolation (the book concatenates), `is` pattern-test expressions,
  postfix `?` (this round PARKED ?-propagation; the old grammar had
  already committed a surface for it), and `#capability` effect tags on
  function types (the concrete surface for the still-open effect-system
  fork; round-4 verdict was "mhhaaaybe").
- **Old declaration-ordered total order** (variants by position, fields in
  declaration order — "reordering fields is a semantic change") vs the new
  corpus, which never pinned WHAT the structural order is. The old rule is
  probably right and should just be adopted explicitly.

## Feel

The old spec reads like an engine constitution — numbered invariants, each
with provenance and an enforcing harness, ruthless about the boundary
(open semantics / proprietary trust). The new corpus reads like a
language that expects to be learned. They are the same design DAYS apart (the
old round's rulings are dated 2026-07-01..04; this round ran 07-06..09) —
so the convergence is not independent validation but proof the convictions
are stable across restarts and that this round's agents, who never read
the old texts, re-derived them faithfully from conversation alone. The deltas that
matter are the four numbered imports above — especially V10, which is a
correctness hole with a recorded incident, not a taste question.

## The zoo epoch (March 2026) — the actually-old design

Correction to everything above: there are THREE generations, not two.
`~/vixenware/vixen-zoo/*.vx` (March: `lua.vx`, `lua-next.vx`, `build.vx`,
`amos.vx`, + `lua-gaps.md`/`lua-next-notes.md`) is the genuinely old
epoch; the July 1–4 round (vix-spec V1–V32, types sketch) was already a
deliberate reset of it — V31 ("syntax spends the fewest innovation
points") reads as the ruling that killed the zoo's surface. The book
unknowingly landed on the July side of that massacre almost everywhere.

What the zoo language looked like (lua-next.vx, its apex):

```
fn discover_tool(class: ExecutorClass, name: String) -> DiscoveredTool (
  let which = discover_exec(class, ["which", name]);
  let path = which.stdout.utf8!.trim!;
  ...
)
let liblua = (all_lib_sources.map compile).merge!;
cexec [ar, "rc", @out/liblua.a, ..objs] |> cexec [ranlib, _]
```

- **Unary no-parens application** (`f x`, `Tree.from_path ws`) with
  dot-binds-tighter rules; **parens as block expressions** (fn bodies in
  `( … )`).
- **`!` as zero-arg invocation** (`blob.utf8!` — explicitly NOT forcing),
  `.method!` adapters, `$` closure shorthand, `(x) => body` arrows.
- **`|>` pipelines with `_` placeholder.**
- **`@` path sigil** in four forms (`@out/liblua.a`, `@(out/{file}.o)`).
- **Backtick template strings with `${}`** + the **`fail`** keyword.
- **`%{ k => v }` map literals**, `[..a, ..b]` array spread,
  `let {cc, ar, ranlib} = tools` record destructuring, `Symbol` literals
  (`:cc`), `[]` generics, **`#fs`/`#host` effect tags on functions**.
- **`namespace Type { … }` methods + import-scoped `extend Type`** — a
  full user-method story with a coherence answer.
- **`where { … }` / `with { … }` keyword-argument blocks**, `partial f(x)`
  explicit partial application.
- **Exec with observer closures** — `observer: (proc, vfs) => …` shipped
  to the executor, `stabilize(witness/resolve)` as the pin primitive,
  `executor_class("ssh:orb")` multi-host targeting, and capability
  queries like `RustToolchain where (version >= 1.91)`.

### Salvage list — zoo features with NO story in the book

1. **Methods on user types** (`namespace`/`extend`). The book's methods
   are all builtin (collections); a user defining `fn area(self: Shape)`
   has no home. The zoo had the answer including extension coherence.
2. **String interpolation** — zoo backticks + old grammar `${…}`; the
   book concatenates with `+`. Almost certainly wanted back.
3. **`fail` / user-raised failure** with interpolated messages — the
   book's failure story covers machine failures (unwrap, div-zero) only.
4. **Map/Tree literal syntax: three generations, three answers** — zoo
   `%{ k => v }`, July sketch "no literal, `Map::from`, boring on
   purpose", ratchet `{}`. Needs ONE ruling.
5. **Array spread** `[..a, ..b]` — the book never says how arrays concat.
6. **Effect tags on functions** (`#fs`, and grammar-era `#capability` on
   `Fn` types) — two concrete prior surfaces for the still-open effect
   fork.
7. **Exec observers** — **SETTLED, round 12: no observer surface survives.**
   The March model shipped a closure to observe the process; `exec` now
   returns `ExecOutcome { tree, stdout, stderr }` whose stream fields are
   codata, and you observe them by **placing the surrounding block**
   (`r[machine.primitive.exec-outcome]`,
   `r[machine.primitive.exec-is-placement-agnostic]`). The observer closure
   is the *lowering* of that placed block, not something anyone writes.
   Nothing to salvage as syntax; the salvaged *finding* is that readiness is
   a protocol fact, not a filesystem fact (`/vix-design/exec-observers`).
8. **Multi-host surface** — executor classes, capability version queries.
   vixd territory now, but the zoo had SYNTAX for it.
9. `partial` application; record-destructuring `let`; `Symbol` type —
   smaller, each worth a deliberate yes/no rather than silence.
