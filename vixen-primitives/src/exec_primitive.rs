//! `exec` — the process-running effect as a REGISTERED primitive.
//!
//! **Why this is a primitive and not a machine op.** It was `Op::Exec` until
//! now, the last capability-carrying effect resident in the scheduler (issue
//! 2597). The scheduler kept exactly what `machine.primitive.registered`
//! permits — keying, parking, admission, receipts — but it also owned the
//! process boundary, the workspace capture, the termination mapping, and a
//! per-tool record-name match selecting the output protocol, which is exactly
//! what `machine.capability.no-argv-dialect` bans from machine code. All of
//! that is domain knowledge, and it lives HERE now: `vixen-primitives` is
//! allowed to know what a `ProgressiveSh` is; `vix-core` is not.
//!
//! The demand identity is unchanged in shape: "this plan under this
//! capability". The request's capability field is a capability-ROLE argument,
//! so its identity is the demand preimage's argument and its value (the
//! `$program` executable name) is redeemed only here, host-side; the
//! materialized argv is the normalized plan the closure hashes
//! (`machine.primitive.capability-role`, `machine.primitive.exec-plan-normalized`).
//!
//! The process boundary itself stays behind the [`ExecBackend`] service
//! (`machine.primitive.effect-backend-service`): this primitive spawns
//! nothing — it asks the installed backend to, and a snapshot without one
//! fails loudly. The host-trusting default backend supports no `Hermetic`
//! claim, which is why the effect's capability witness is recorded
//! `Unverifiable` (`machine.primitive.memo-policy`).
//!
